This plugin provides both real-time and on-demand scanning of Python files with Mypy from within PyCharm/IDEA.

Mypy is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells 
(as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).

## Installation steps
1. In the **Settings/Preferences** dialog (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>), click **Plugins**. The [Plugins page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/plugins-settings.html) opens.
2. Click **Browse repositories**.
3. In the [Browse Repositories dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/browse-repositories-dialog.html) that opens, right-click on the plugin named **Mypy** and select **Download and Install**.
4. Confirm your intention to download and install the selected plugin.
5. Click **Close**.
6. Click **OK** in the **Settings** dialog and restart PyCharm for the changes to take effect.

## Configuration

The only configuration needed is to set the path to Mypy executable, and only if is not already
inside the PATH environment variable.

To reach the Plugin configuration screen you can open **Settings/Preferences** dialog (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>), click **Other Settings**  and then **Mypy** or simply click the gear icon from the side bar of the Mypy tool window.

To change the path to your Mypy executable you can either type the path directly or use 
the Browse button to open a file selection dialog.

Once you changed the path you should press the Test button to check if the plugin is able to run
the executable.

### Inspection severity

By default, Mypy message severity is set to Warning. It is possible to change the severity level
by going to **Settings/Preferences** dialog (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>) -> **Editor** -> **Inspections** -> **Mypy** -> **Severity**:

## FAQ
### When I click "Check Project/Module/Changes" I only get one error for one file, why?
It is a [know issue](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3850) of `mypy`: if the validation encounters a blocking error it just bails out completely ignoring the rest of the files. The biggest problem for the plugin is that currently there is no way to know if the check ended normally or because it encountered a blocking error (in the issue ticket there was a suggestion of using `--verbose` but it does not work, for exampble, for `duplicate module naned` errors).

### How can I prevent the code inspection to run on a specific folder?

The easiest way to ignore a specific folder is to mark it as Excluded from PyCharm/IDEA:

1. Open PyCharm/IDEA Settings -> *your project* -> Project structure
2. Select the directory you want to exclude
3. Click the Excluded button (red folder icon)

More info [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-folders-within-a-content-root.html#mark). 

### The name of the plugin is `mypy-pycharm`, can I use it also with IntelliJ IDEA?

This plugin officially supports only PyCharm, but it should work also on IntelliJ IDEA
if you have the [Python Community Edition](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7322-python-community-edition)
plugin installed. If it does not work, feel free to open a bug on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/leinardi/mypy-pycharm/issues).

### I like this plugin, how can I support it?
